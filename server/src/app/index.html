        /* Given we will create a list and a cart component,
           you can display them next to eachother by making a flexbox out of the body for example */

    <!--
        - Product team decides what features show where on the main page
        - Team marketing takes care of retrieving and showing the hotness list from Boardgamegeek
        - Client conversion team takes care of the wishlist/shoppingcart

          Tip:
          - Read the main.js first
          - Then start out by building the listLib.js first, then start on the cartLib file.

          When done with the exercise:
          (bonus): Write the selected game to the localStorage after pressing the button in the cart component
          (alternative) Instead of using the final lines of code in main.js, You could also already add the custom elements in the HTML here.
          (alternative) You could also add attributes which can be immediatly read to do (for example) some event Listening
